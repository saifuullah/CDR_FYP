<h1> What is the difference between react and react Native? </h1>


<h1> History </h1>
<h3> React </h3>
ReactJS (React or React.js) is defined as an open source JavaScript library (not a framework) for building user interfaces.It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook, The first prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.
<h3> React Native </h3>
React Native is one of the most popular mobile app development frameworks. Facebook open sourced its codebase in 2015. React Native's claim to fame is that it enables execution of JavaScript codes in smartphones, which is a contradiction in itself, and hence interesting.
React was born in Facebook's Ads Org. As Tom Occhino, the then React team lead at Facebook, said in his keynote address in the first-ever React.js conference in 2015, it all started very simple and fast and straightforward. The typical MVC approach was used for developing and deploying the Facebook ads platform. But as new features were added, things started to get complex.
<h3> Node JS </h3>
Node JS was born in 2009. In 2009, Ryan Dahl wrote Node.js. At first, Node.js supported only Mac OS X and Linux. Dahl led the development and maintenance and later it was sponsored by Joyent. On November 8, 2009 at the inaugural European JSConf, the Node.js project was first demonstrated by Dahl. Node.js is a combination the V8 JavaScript Chrome engine, a low-level I/O API, and an event loop.
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.


<h1> What is React </h1>
ReactJS offers graceful solutions to some of front-end programming’s most persistent issues, allowing you to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease. It’s fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community that’s rapidly growing.In React, each building blocks is called components. React uses the concept of virtual DOM so if any changes occures in the webpage, React created the Virtual DOM and compare the 2 DOMS (Actual and Virtual) and reflects these changes. Hance it does not load complete pages instead it updates only those components.
<h1> What is React Native </h1>
"Learn once, Build everywhere"

React native the most popular JS framework for building native applications for cross platforms. 
The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via serialized data over an asynchronous and batched bridge
React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.
While React Native styling has a similar syntax to CSS, it does not use HTML or CSS.Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java or Kotlin for Android, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and C++/WinRT or C# for Windows 10, which makes it even more flexible. 

<h1> What is Node JS </h1>
ode.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
A Node.js app runs in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request. Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
