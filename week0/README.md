<h1> What is the difference between react and react Native? </h1>


<h1> History </h1>
<h3> React </h3>
ReactJS (React or React.js) is defined as an open source JavaScript library (not a framework) for building user interfaces.It was created by Jordan Walke, who was a software engineer at Facebook, The first prototype of React called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012.
<h3> React Native </h3>
React Native is one of the most popular mobile app development frameworks. Facebook open sourced its codebase in 2015. React Native's claim to fame is that it enables execution of JavaScript codes in smartphones, which is a contradiction in itself, and hence interesting.
React was born in Facebook's Ads Org. As Tom Occhino, the then React team lead at Facebook, said in his keynote address in the first-ever React.js conference in 2015, it all started very simple and fast and straightforward. The typical MVC approach was used for developing and deploying the Facebook ads platform. But as new features were added, things started to get complex.


<h1> What is React </h1>
ReactJS offers graceful solutions to some of front-end programming’s most persistent issues, allowing you to build dynamic and interactive web apps with ease. It’s fast, scalable, flexible, powerful, and has a robust developer community that’s rapidly growing.In React, each building blocks is called components. React uses the concept of virtual DOM so if any changes occures in the webpage, React created the Virtual DOM and compare the 2 DOMS (Actual and Virtual) and reflects these changes. Hance it does not load complete pages instead it updates only those components.
<h1> What is React Native </h1>
**Learn once, Build everywhere**
React native the most popular JS framework for building native applications for cross platforms. 
The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM. It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via serialized data over an asynchronous and batched bridge
React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via React’s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.
While React Native styling has a similar syntax to CSS, it does not use HTML or CSS.Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views. React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java or Kotlin for Android, Objective-C or Swift for iOS, and C++/WinRT or C# for Windows 10, which makes it even more flexible.
